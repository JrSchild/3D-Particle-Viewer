# It is a work in progress and thus just a draft

# define all (environment) variables and properties used by the field.
properties: (object)
 |
 |	# representing the dimensions of the field, in coordinates
 |-	width: (int)
 |-	height: (int)
 |-	depth: (int)
 |	
 |	# defining the different type of molecules used in the animation. Add property information like color, size?
 |-	types: (object)
	 |
	 |	# add new types as follow
	 |-	typeName: (object)
		 |
		 |	# color code of molecule
		 |-	color: (string)
		 |	# define the size of the molecule in the range of 1 - 10
		 |-	size: (int)

# an array of all molecules, the molecules[i] is also the unique ID.
molecules: (array)
 |	
 |	# each item in the molecules array represents one molecule.
 |-	molecules[i]: (object)
	 |	
	 |	# the value of type has to be one of the defined types in the properties object earlier
	 |-	type: (string)
		
# every item in the animation array represents one "frame" (step)
# the engine will take care of the animations between them
animation: (array)
 |	
 |	# one step in the animation, this item contains a list of ALL particles (same number of itmes in arr molecules)
 |-	animation[i]: (array)
	 |	
	 |	# contains the new coordinates voor i at step y. Example: [20, 30, 50]
	 |-	animation[i][y]: (array)
