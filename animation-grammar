# This file represents the grammar used by the 3D Particle Viewer.
# It is a work in progress and likely to change in the future.
# For now this is in line with the existing generated json files.

# Define all (environment) variables and properties used by the field.

# An object of all molecules and which type the molecule is.
molecules: (object)

 |	# It's ID is preferably a number starting from 0.
 |-	(id) molecule: (object)

	 |	# The value of type has to be defined in the program itself. This happens in particle-viewer.molecules.js.

# Every item in the animation array represents one "frame" (step).
# The engine will take care of the animations between them.
# Molecules not present in the animation will not be displayed on the screen until present again.
# This way you can "merge" two molecules together by hiding them both and showing a new, different molecule on the screen.
# A simple example of this is in short_collision.json.
animation: (array)
