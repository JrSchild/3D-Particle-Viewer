3D-Particle-Viewer
==================

This small "engine" is used create 3D visualisations of particles. In the back it uses Three.js. A json file representing the animation can be loaded.

In the current example the animation is overwritten by generating an x amount of molecules and moving them randomly over the field for an x amount of time.
